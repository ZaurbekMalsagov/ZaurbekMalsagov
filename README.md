## Additional Information

About me
I graduated with honours from MAI with a bachelor's degree in "Automation of Technological Processes and Productions", then applied for a masters degree program of NITU "MISIS" in the field of "Informatics and Computer Engineering", which I also graduated from with honours in August 2022. For almost 2 years I worked at the State Space Research and Production Center named after M.V. Khrunichev as an engineer-programmer.

At the university, I did a term paper on SQL queries. In the bachelor's degree on the subject "Numerical and Analytical Methods" I wrote programs in C++ to solve systems of equations by various methods. I took courses "Basics of Programming in C", where I solved more than 300 tasks. Also I have undergone a month intensive school 21 from Sber, where I solved various tasks in the C language and learned to work in a team using git.

At the moment I am studying at "School 21" (an educational project from Sber for developers) and developing desktop applications for automating production tasks at LLC "Mirax".
